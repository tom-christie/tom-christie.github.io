I'm working towards finishing my PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of Minnesota. I've worked in neuroimaging, speech processing and decision making labs, and have a graduate minor in Computer Science.  I'm broadly interested in learning and action selection, both in humans and from a computational point of view.

I live in St. Paul, Minnesota with my wife and son.
