Setting up a site on github.io and getting all the bells and whistles to work has been a headache. Now that it *does* work, I thought I'd take a minute to write down what I did so anyone following along at home can do the same.

First, go here:



## Code highlighting

This was a pain.  

## Latex Rendering

I got this to work using the instructions found [here](http://www.vincebuffalo.com/2012/02/20/another-post.html).

Sort of. 

Eventually it created images but didn't include them in the page.
