 -- get tweening out to work - base it on splash page
 -- make another level for YZ

 -- when should message come up?  i.e. how often, what sequence, specifically?
    - switch between all the thigns we want to train on on a regular basis to make a mixed experience in several contexts
    - have two pairs (X,Z and Y,Z), switch back and forth between these
    - poisson process kill rate, function of time (rate only), exponential waiting time between events, event counts: poisson distribution
    - proportions become gaussian distributed, with mean = sd
    - statistical evidence (samples) in a certain number of minutes
    - laser has rate lambda1, laser2 has rate lambda2 (kill rate, not fire rate)
    - use probability for each laser, controlled by the user
    - evidence=kill1/(kill1+kill2) = use1lambda1/T/(use1lambda1 + (1-use1)lambda2/T) = u*lambda1/(u*lambda1 + (1-u)lambda2)
    this is logistic = 1/(1+[1-u]/u*lambda2/lambda1), this is the odds
    - there's a distribution on this statistic, chi square distributed,
    - more kills gives more evidence
    - P(P1-hat) ~ X^2
    - as a function of time, we need E[P1-hat] as a function of the amount of time in the game, i.e. lambda1, lambda2, u,
    - be between 0 and 1
    - paul estimates 400 events or so
 -- show an example from the other BEFORE elicitation

 -- what should the context look like on the weapon select page?  ->> have creeps and colonies in the background
 -- what happens when goons hit the mine? -->  (points?)
 -- how much ore is there to use? --> lots at first, but eventually based on hwo much you send
 -- what do we do with the crystals that we collect? --> get money (global points)



 -- could have sealed-price option, sealed-bid auction mechanism
   want more supplies, bid to higher up. best bid gets the available supplies.

 xx A BA A A A B B B occurs separately
 xx clean up chooser background
 xx fluctuation --> probability matching, deterministic -> all or none, because they have higher confidence
    how many exposures do they need to always pick the better option in a determistic context?
 xx when "resources required" comes up, make the screen grey and make it so that you can't do anything except click
 xx make new icon for new tower
 xx RED can have different rates in both context - we want RELATIVE comparisons, NOT absolutes

 -- timing on when the red thing appears
 xx last in first out cue (last thing they chose is the first thing they restocked)
    keep popping in restock
 xx have a total to send, then multiply by proportional bar height (doing but not showing)
 xx connect crystal choices to amt of crystals available
 -- strength ratios - linear in log likelihood ratio, ONLY for calibration phase, how sensitive people are to the information
 -- change strengths to depend on contexts, but be relatively the same

 xx make crystals blink when they run out
 xx put message about whether the base will have YOUR supplies or not



Base / Collection / Sending / Usage connections

- not all restocking can matter
- when they do matter, it should be strictly the previous one


Distribution of Crystals
1. Binomial draw - from a total of, say, 6
2. Based on previous choices
Random draw to determine which one we do

Have a queue of bases that we've stocked (sent to)
Go to the most recent one of THAT base (LIFO queue),
then do a 50/50 chance of either using that proportion, OR random from binomial
Tell subject whether they're resources you sent vs what the base has leftover

Step by Step

Playing - Base A - Binomial - collect G & R
Sending - Send to B - Random colors - Proportions oly
Base A -






DATA
- Check goonNum (why so high?)
- add XY coordinates
- add % along path
- fix this :{"label":"crystalCollected","crystalColor":"green","crystals1CollectedCount":0,"crystals2CollectedCount":0}},
- make sure you write out each level - include level number
