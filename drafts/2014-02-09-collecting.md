title: Collecting

One of the more difficult parts about being a graduate student, or probably any type of academic, is wading through the sea of information in your field.  Papers are so numerous and there's always something you haven't read but should have.  Neuroscience in particular is a field without a clear organizational scheme.  So much data is collected, but unlike physics or chemistry, there is no overriding theory to contextualize the data and help it make sense. It's just a collection of facts, and those are hard to keep track of.

One nice thing about most academic papers is that they start with an introduction. The introduction is usually a mini-review, where the authors provide a brief history of he problem they are working on and give their investigation some context.  They frequently give very brief descriptions of findings from other sources.  For example, the following is in the intro to one paper:

> Psychological research on dynamic decision making began with Toda's (1962) pioneering study of human performance on a game called the "fungus eater," in which human subjects controlled a robot's search for uranium and fuel on a hypothetical planet.

This gives a nice description of an important paper in the field of decision making.  It would be handy to have some way to store this information and be able to recall it when I'm looking for
