      <h1 id="hippocampus">Hippocampus</h1>
<p>In our cognitive science class today we had a guest lecturer in to talk about the hippocampus, an evolutionarily old part of the brain that literally means “horse sea monster,” because it looks like a seahorse.  The hippocampus is wild: after a rat wanders around in a box or a maze for a little while, individual cells in the hippocampus fire that correspond to different locations in the area when the rat is at that location.  If you have a place X, the cluster of neurons associated with X begin to fire when the rat approaches X, fire really fast at X, and fire more slowly when the rat leaves.</p>

(thanks Wikipedia)</p>

<p>You determine which cells are associated with which location using a process called “decoding,” which is basically machine learning as applied to cell recordings.  You record the hippocampal cells  as the rat wanders around and find correlations between which cells fire and where the rat is.  The cool thing is that after you have the cells mapped (the lingo is that you’ve found the “tuning curve” associated with each cell), you can then figure out where the rat is in the maze or the box just by looking at which cells fire.  In other words, you can read the rat’s mind.</p>

<p>Lesions (a euphemism for cuts or strokes or other injuries) in the hippocampus are associated with a loss of the ability to turn short term memories into long term ones.  The most famous case is a guy referred to as HM, who had his hippocampi  removed (there are actually two, one for each side of the brain) because he was having terrible seizures originating in that area of the brain.  After his surgery, he could remember new things for a few minutes – you could have a conversation with him – but no longer.  He couldn’t make any new memories, and all of his memories were from before the surgery.  The idea is that the hippocampus acts as a very impressionable short term memory, which then trains up the larger and slower-to-learn cortex to remember things that are important.  HM lost this ability, so he couldn’t store any memories long term.</p>

<p>The top half of the image shows the maze. The bottom half shows the “decoded” information from the rat, or, where the rat is imagining it is. The small white X is the actual location of the rat and the colors represent the predicted location of the rat based on hippocampal recordings, so in this case you can see the rat visualize moving going to the left.</p>

<p>The hippocampus has also been implicated in dealing episodic memory and memory of places, which is why the rat business makes sense.  The lecture we heard today also gave strong evidence that rats imagine: when they reach a turning point in a maze where they can go either left or right, recordings of their hippocampal cells show that they briefly light up in each direction – in other words, they imagine what it would be like to go in each direction.  This is huge.  The hippocampus doesn’t just store memories, it stores imaginings as well.  Or if looked at another way, it stores past and future imaginings.  The past ones we call memories, and the future ones we call imaginings, or daydreams, or prediction, or whatever.  The rats project, imagine, what they would experience around each turn, and then decide which way to go.</p>

<p>According to the lecturer, the way the hippocampus keeps tabs on places is a combination of what he called dead reckoning (if you take a step forward, you intuitively know where you are relative to the previous step without the need of your senses) and sensory information.  If you just use dead reckoning, you end up way off course because you have small errors that compound.  Sensory associations with each location help lock the dead reckoned guess of location down to particular environmental landmarks.</p>

<p>The dead reckoning apparently is aided by so-called grid cells, located in an area nearby the hippocampus.  Turns out oscillatory patterns in the brain near the hippocampus act as an internal clock that keeps tabs on where we are and when.  An article on how these grid cells work has recently been published, and here’s a synopsis.</p>

<p>At first it seems amazing that specific cells in the brain encode specific locations in space (where “encode” is used in the odd neuroscience way, and really means “is correlated with” rather than “contains all the information related to”).   But after awhile you realize that if there’s a mental event, it must have physical correlates of some sort, because after all, it happens in the brain.  And even if the brain constantly reconfigures itself and creates on-the-fly neural assemblies to complete individual tasks as some suggest, there’s no reason a particular set of neurons can’t reliably end up in an assembly for a certain task.  For some reason it’s still fascinating, even surprising, when a neural correlate of a new mental phenomenon is found.  But what is the mind if not the brain?  What is the brain if not a collection of neurons?</p>
